          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Abdul Rafay, a MERN Stack developer with a passion
          for crafting dynamic, responsive web applications that truly make an
          impact. My journey into web development began with a natural curiosity
          about how websites work, which led me to formal training at Saylani
          Mass IT Training. There, I built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js.

          As I continued to learn and grow, I embraced challenging projects that
          honed my skills. During my recent internship, I developed key HRMS
          modulesâ€”including an automated payroll system and biometric attendance
          integrationâ€”to streamline complex business processes. In my freelance
          work, I designed a CRM and ticketing system with role-based access
          control, significantly boosting customer support efficiency.

          I thrive on turning complex challenges into intuitive, user-friendly
          solutions. Eager to stay at the forefront of technology, Iâ€™m excited
          to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of
          whatâ€™s possible.
